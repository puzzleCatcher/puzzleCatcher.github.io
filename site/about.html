                        <p>I was inspired to create this project from a trip to India that I had in 8th grade (2022). During this trip, my grandfather showed me a computer center that he helped create in Bihar. The computer center was located in a small and pretty remote village in Begusarai, where there was little access to resources such as the Internet. The computer center allowed many kids in the village to learn some skills in the future that would be beneficial in future years.</p>
                        
                        <p>The project was initially to create a CS curriculum for that village in India, along with possibly providing computers for them but I changed my plan after trying to figure out the logistics of the project. Contacting the village was very difficult since it was in a remote location and the internet there wasn't optimal.</p>
                        
                        <p>I decided to shift my project to first create a CS curriculum website. Once I have the website, I could give it to different communities, whether locally or in India. With my new project idea, my driving question was "How can I create a CS Curriculum that would benefit a wider audience"?</p>
                        
                        <p>I really enjoyed creating this project as I learned a lot more about incorporating creativity and teaching into the field of computer science and programming. I have always enjoyed creating CS projects for fun, but this is one of the first times I created something that could have a lasting impact on the community and would help them in future years.</p>
